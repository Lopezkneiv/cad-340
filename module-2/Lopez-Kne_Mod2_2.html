        <h2>Introduction to Myself</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Ivan Lopez-Kne and I live in Coon Rapids, Minnesota. I moved here from Boston when I was an infant, and have spent the vast majority of my life here. I briefly attended college in Moorhead, Minnesota but quickly came back when my program was cut.</p>
        <p> I have studied music, journalism, and now software development. It has been a rocky road trying to find a solid path in life, but it has let me explore plenty of interests and discover new hobbies I never considered! I’m excited to continue learning about software development though Bellevue!</p>
        <p> In my free time I enjoy finding new ways to make more delicious foods. I have experimented with cake baking, sous vide, grilling, and a few other cooking methods. If you have never had a nice sous vide steak or chicken, you should try to find a way to do it!</p>
        <p> I’m highly interested in the classes here at Bellevue. It has been difficult to learn so much at such an expedited pace, but it’s been highly rewarding. 
            <span class="sentence">I’m excited to dive deeper into the world of web development and create my own webpage!</p>
